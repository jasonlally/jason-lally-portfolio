I am currently the Data Services Manager for [DataSF in the City and County of San Francisco](https://datasf.org). I lead the team and manage our [portfolio of data services which include data engineering, analytics and data science](https://datasf.org/about). I started at the City in August 2013 through the Mayorâ€™s Innovation Fellowship under the late Mayor Edwin M. Lee and joined DataSF in August of 2014.

Before working at the City, I worked at the intersection of technology and urban planning as Director of the Decision Lab at PlaceMatters in Denver, CO. I came to open government and open data through my work in cities and regions across the country on data-informed, community planning processes. 

I enjoy my life in the heart of San Francisco living with my loving partner and our two cats, Ru and Paul.

## Values
Wherever I go, I bring the following values with me:

1. **Courage.** No, not the hollywood-style strongman version of courage, but the kind that comes in the midst of vulnerability and uncertainty. You do not have courage, you practice it. As Brene Brown says: "Embrace the suck" 
2. **Authenticity.** I've been told I wear my heart on my sleeve. To me, this is a strength. I thrive in environments where I can know and be known. We all armor up for many reasons, but I do believe it's possible to find authentic connections even when it's hard.
3. **Collaboration.** I am naturally collaborative. I prefer working with multi-disciplinary people on common problems. I believe there is strength in diversity.
4. **Empathy.** Many of the problems I work on are challenges of the heart, of people working in organizations. To really lead and bring people together requires empathy.
