## Project goals

The Open Data Program is really many projects supporting **timely data made easily available** to City departments as well as the public. This means data is offered:

1. At no-cost
2. With permissive licensing
3. In machine readable formats including via Application Programming Interfaces

In addition, the program supports:

1. Improved knowledge of data assets
2. Data governance around those assets
2. Increased use of data in decision-making 

## Approach

It is impossible to plan for all contingenices within a dynamic and federated City. Our overriding approach at DataSF e use lean, continuous improvement cycles to plan, do, check, and act on deliverables.

The open data program can be broken into several work streams that support the goal of timely data made easily available. These are:

1. publishing support and automation services, 
2. data coordination, governance and quality management, and
3. user support and training

Below, I'll highlight some examples of projects and
